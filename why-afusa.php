                                  <p class="needsPar">Walter J. Yahn founded advanced Finishing U.S.A. in 1970. A Penn State Industrial Engineer by profession, Walt was a visionary. He foresaw the growth of the powder coatings industry and its potential contribution to manufacturing in the region. This propelled him to establish Advanced Finishing U.S.A. and to develop a full array of powder coating technologies and capabilities.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar">Walt slowly built his company into a leading powder coating specialty business, creating a reputation for quick response, customer focus and uncompromised attention to quality.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar">Our work can be found in products produced by global corporate giants such as General Electric, Alstom,  Bombardier, Komatsu, Westinghouse, Disney, Mitsubishi and Kawasaki to one-person "garage shop" operations and individual consumers.
