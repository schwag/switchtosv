                                  <p class="needsPar">Advanced Finishing U.S.A. specializes in applying strong, durable powder coatings to industrial equipment, fabrications, castings, stampings and extrusions. Founded by visionary Walter J. Yahn in 1970. A Penn State Industrial Engineer by profession, Walt foresaw the growth of the powder coatings industry and its potential contribution to manufacturing in the region. This propelled him to establish Advanced Finishing U.S.A. and to develop a full array of powder coating technologies and capabilities.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar">Walt was an early student of Deming and the other pioneers of the Total Quality Management movement. He understood immediately the importance of customer focus, quality, and service.</p>
                                  <p class="needsPar">With these principles firmly rooted, Walt built his company into a leading powder coating specialty business, creating a reputation for quick response, customer focus and uncompromised attention to quality. Today, our family-owned 80,000 square foot facility serves customers such as General Electric, Altom, Mitsubishi, Komatsu, Westinghouse, Kawasaki, Disney, and Bombardier, to one-person "garage shop" operations and individual consumers. </p>
